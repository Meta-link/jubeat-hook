All of this was possible thanks to the incredible work of aixxe and their wonderful articles about hacking IIDX scores (starting [here](https://aixxe.net/2019/06/iidx-score-data)). I also took a lot of inspirations from  [ChunItachi](https://github.com/tomatosoupcan/ChunItachi). And of course, thanks to all the people and friends from various discord who helped me during the creating of this tool !
